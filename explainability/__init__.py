# secure-healthcare-ml/explainability/__init__.py

# The __init__.py file marks the directory as a Python package.
# You can place any package-level imports or initialization code here.

# For example, if you want to import explainability functions for easy access:
# from .shap_explainability import explain_with_shap
# from .lime_explainability import explain_with_lime

# Or if you have constants or configurations related to explainability:
# from .config import EXPLAINABILITY_MODEL_PARAMS

# Example:
# __all__ = ['shap_explainability', 'lime_explainability', 'config']
